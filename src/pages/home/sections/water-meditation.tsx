        Paddle into nature, enjoy a guided meditation and find your peace. OWM is a unique way to find balance while
        living a big city life. The Tampa Bay area has over 3 million people hustling and bustling and traffic jamming,
        which can camouflage the inspiring and wonder of the back yard we all share! Let us take a minute to stop, smell
        the ocean, and practice mindfulness whilst floating on top of it.
